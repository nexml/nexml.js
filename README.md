NeXML JavaScript libraries
--------------------------
The JavaScript libraries use the [badgerfish](http://badgerfish.ning.com/) mapping of (Ne)XML onto JSON. 
The `jsonlib/nexml.js` library wraps around such JSON objects and exposes them in a bean-like way.
Example usage is shown in `jsonlib/nexml-js.html`
